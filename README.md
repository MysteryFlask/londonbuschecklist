# London Bus Checklist
A very, very simple React app that allows you to keep track of which London (Transport for London) buses you have been on, using localStorage to save the list and keep the checkboxes ticked.

NOTE: These are the full bus routes without any temporary diversions or changes included. For permanent changes, I will try to update this frequently to include the latest information.

No API keys or coding is needed! Simply download it and run it as you would with any Create React App normally.
